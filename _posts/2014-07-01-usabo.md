[Here's a link](http://web.mit.edu/~csvoss/Public/usabo/) to some of the resources I created for students at this year's [USA Biology Olympiad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Biology_Olympiad) training camp.

I first put up this page so that I could direct all of the students to one place if they wanted access to the notes later, but it's also useful for knowledge transfer to future generations of USABO counselors.
