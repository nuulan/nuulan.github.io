*Problem-solving meets philosophy as we explore mind-blowing ideas from the theoretical study of complex systems: computers, minds, and beyond.*

The website for the course that I taught in Junction 2014 is [here](http://csvoss.scripts.mit.edu/junction): it contains links to many of my favorite theoretical computer science teaching materials.

*Mathematical Insights in Computing* was a six-week-long, four-session-per-week class that I designed and taught for MIT ESP's  [Junction](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Junction/2014/computing.html) summer program in 2014. Based on an MIT class I took -- [6.045](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-045j-automata-computability-and-complexity-spring-2011/), *Automata, Computability, and Complexity* -- this class synthesized many of my favorite concepts in computer science into a rigorous course for advanced high school students.
