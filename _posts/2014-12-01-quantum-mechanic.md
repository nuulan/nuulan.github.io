Play around with simulations of quantum circuits!

[**QuantumMechanic**](http://quantummechanic.xvm.mit.edu:8000/) [currently down] simulates and displays quantum circuits using [QuTiP](http://qutip.org/), and outputs the behaviour of the resulting n-qubit circuit as a 2<sup>n</sup>-by-2<sup>n</sup> unitary matrix. (Naturally, this means you're not allowed to use very many qubits!)

Built as my final project in [6.845: Quantum Complexity Theory](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa14/6.845/index.html).

See the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/csvoss/quantummechanic).
