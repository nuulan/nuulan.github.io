I want to share [**this problem**](http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/problems2014/N2014-F.pdf) that I wrote, which was included in the 2014 [North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad](http://www.nacloweb.org/); it involves the  [Lontara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lontara_alphabet) writing system.
