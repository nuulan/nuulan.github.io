Hi! I'm Chelsea, and this is where I blog.

As of fall 2017, I work as a software engineer at [Pilot.com](http://pilot.com/). We solve bookkeeping for startups. It's an amazing team!

Previously, I have been a software engineer at [Wave](http://wave.com/) and an intern on the infrastructure team at [Khan Academy](http://engineering.khanacademy.org/posts/stories-from-interns.htm). I have also taught as an instructor at [SPARC](http://sparc-camp.org/), at the [USA Biology Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Biology_Olympiad), and at the [USA Computing Olympiad](https://web.archive.org/web/20160801012754/http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=staff).

I graduated from MIT in 2015 with a major in computer science (Course 6-3) and a minor in mathematics (Course 18). In 2016, I completed the [M.Eng.](http://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/6-p-meng-program) degree with a concentration in theoretical computer science. My thesis research applied logical inference with SMT solvers to the modeling of cellular signaling pathways, and was presented at [Static Analysis in Systems Biology](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sasb2017/). I collaborated with the [Fontana Lab](http://fontana.med.harvard.edu/www/index.htm) at Harvard Medical School, and was advised by Prof. [Jean Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jyang2/).
